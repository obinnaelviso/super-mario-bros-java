# 2D Game Development with Java (Super Mario Bros)

Welcome to the 2D Game Development project using Java! This project aims to provide a starting point for creating a 2D
game from scratch using the Java programming language.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a foundation for developing a 2D game. It includes basic game mechanics, graphics rendering,
input handling, and collision detection. By following the instructions and building upon this project, you can create
your own customized 2D game.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 8 or higher
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse or NetBeans IDE for Java
  development

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: git
   clone https://github.com/obinnaelviso/super-mario-bros-java.git
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Explore the project structure and familiarize yourself with the existing codebase.

4. Build and run the project to ensure everything is set up correctly.

5. Customize the game as per your requirements. You can modify the existing code or add new features to create your
   unique 2D game.

6. Test your game thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.

## Features

This project includes the following features:

- Basic game loop implementation.
- Rendering of game graphics using Java's 2D graphics capabilities.
- Input handling for keyboard and mouse events.
- Collision detection for game objects.
- Sample game assets (images and sounds) for reference.

Feel free to modify or extend these features to suit your game development needs.
